            Love<br>
            Love, love, love, love, love (sex)<br>
            Love, love, love, love, love (sex)<br>
        </p>

            The Sun don't shine when I'm alone<br>
            I lose my mind and I lose control<br>
            I see your eyes look through my soul<br>
            Don't be surprised, this is all I know<br>

            I felt the highs and they felt like you<br>
            See, a love like mine is too good to be true<br>
            And you too divine to just be mine<br>
            You remind me of the color blue<br>

            Well, baby, you were everything I ever wanted<br>
            Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket<br>
            Planned to ask the other day<br>
            Knew you'd run away<br>
            So I guess I just forgot it<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember when you went away to college<br>
            I was on the phone, we ain't no talkin'<br>
            Past, present, future, all the gossip<br>
            God damn<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Puppy love ain't what it was darlin'<br>
            Feelings that we have are so alarmin'<br>
            I can make you laugh<br>
            I can break the glass<br>
            If we made it last, it'd be a bargin<br>

            Mr. Charmin', that is my department
            You was there before the fancy cars and
            You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
            When the car was havin' trouble startin'
        </p>

            Now we got our own apartment<br>
            Same box for the mail<br>
            Same hemp for the laundry<br>
            The food in the fridge is stale<br>
            And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed<br>
            You said: All you ever think about is sex<br>
            I'm like, oh well<br>
            You know me so well<br>
            And if this will make you late, I swear I won't tell<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            And every time I call your phone<br>
            You better pick up your cell<br>
            I swear to God I'ma freak out<br>
            If it go straight to voice mail<br>
        </p>
